# fileupload

In order to run this SpringBoot application, one will need at the very least a APPL_ROOT environment pointing to the directory, 
where one's copy of setup.properties is located.

In addition, this repository already contains a copy of said file, which one can modify so as to suit one's needs.

Finally, a HTML file has also been provided, so that one can then open it in a browser and then process a file together with
types of metadata currently supported by this application.

Note:  currently all supported types of metadata are predetermined.
